# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Robust and Idempotent Test User Seeding Mechanism
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a reusable, idempotent seeding mechanism to create test user accounts with various roles and realistic data for local development and QA workflows.
# Details:
Design and implement a dedicated seeding module or service responsible for creating test users with diverse roles (e.g., admin, standard user, QA, etc.) and realistic attributes (names, emails, profile data). Ensure the seeding logic is idempotentâ€”running the seed multiple times should not create duplicate users or alter existing test users unexpectedly. Use unique identifiers (such as email addresses) to check for existing users before creation. Structure the seed data to cover a range of scenarios relevant to development and QA, including edge cases. Integrate the seeding process into the development workflow via a script or command (e.g., `npm run seed` or a Rails task), and document usage and customization options. Follow best practices for managing object relationships and dependencies to ensure referential integrity and maintainability. Consider using configuration or environment variables to control which users or roles are seeded in different environments.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that running the seeding mechanism multiple times does not create duplicate users or modify existing seeded users unexpectedly. Check that all expected user roles and data variations are present in the database after seeding. Test the seeding process in both a clean and pre-populated database state. Review logs or output for errors or warnings. Confirm that seeded users can be used for authentication and authorization in development and QA workflows. Ensure documentation is clear and up to date, and that the seeding process can be triggered easily by developers and QA engineers.
