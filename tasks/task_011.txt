# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Idempotent Seed Data for Major Models
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create realistic, idempotent seed data for all major models, ensuring seeds can be run multiple times without duplication. Explicitly include the creation of test users for development and QA purposes, covering a variety of user roles and realistic data. Document the process in the README, and ensure the seed process is updated as new models are added.
# Details:
For each major model in the application, define a set of realistic sample records in the seed file(s). Use idempotent patterns such as `find_or_create_by` or equivalent logic to ensure that running the seed process multiple times does not result in duplicate records or data corruption. Where appropriate, update existing records with new attributes to keep seed data current. Consider extracting common seed logic into helper methods for maintainability. Ensure that all relationships and dependencies between models are respected in the seed data. Explicitly create a diverse set of test users for development and QA, covering all user roles and using realistic data. Add clear documentation to the README explaining how to run the seeds, the idempotency guarantees, and how to extend or modify the seed data as models evolve. Establish a process to evaluate all new models as they are created to determine if they require seed data, and update the seed process accordingly.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the seed process on a clean database and verify that all expected records, including test users with various roles, are created with correct attributes and relationships. 2. Run the seed process multiple times and confirm that no duplicate records are created and existing records are updated as intended. 3. Manually inspect the database or use automated tests to ensure data integrity and idempotency. 4. Review the README to ensure the seed process is clearly documented and instructions are accurate. 5. When new models are added, verify that the evaluation process determines if seed data is needed and updates are made as appropriate.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and document all major models requiring seed data [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify all major models in the application that require seed data, including their relationships and dependencies.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive list of all major models in the application. For each model, document its attributes, validations, associations, and any special requirements. Identify dependency chains between models (e.g., Users must exist before Posts). Create a dependency graph to visualize the order in which models should be seeded. Document any existing seed data patterns already in use.

## 2. Design idempotent seeding patterns and helper methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create reusable helper methods and patterns for idempotent data seeding that can be applied across all models.
### Details:
Implement helper methods for common seeding patterns like `find_or_create_by`, `find_or_initialize_by` with attribute updates, and unique constraint handling. Create methods for generating consistent test data (names, emails, dates, etc.) that won't change between seed runs. Design patterns for handling associations in an idempotent way. Implement error handling and logging for seed operations. Consider using transactions where appropriate to ensure data consistency.

## 3. Implement seed data for primary models [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Create seed data for primary models (those with no dependencies on other models) using the idempotent patterns.
### Details:
Using the dependency graph from subtask 1, identify all primary models (those with no dependencies). For each primary model, implement seed data using the helper methods from subtask 2. Create a diverse set of realistic records for each model. Include edge cases and boundary conditions where appropriate. Add comments explaining the purpose of each seed record or group. Ensure all required attributes are populated with realistic values.

## 4. Implement seed data for dependent models [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Create seed data for all remaining models with dependencies, ensuring proper relationship handling.
### Details:
Following the dependency order from subtask 1, implement seed data for all remaining models. Use the helper methods from subtask 2 to ensure idempotency. Reference existing records from primary models when creating associated records. Handle many-to-many relationships appropriately. Ensure foreign key constraints are satisfied. Create a diverse set of relationship patterns (e.g., users with many posts, users with no posts, etc.). Test complex relationship chains to ensure they're correctly established.

## 5. Document seed process in README and create verification script [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Update the project README with comprehensive documentation about the seed process and create a verification script to validate seed data.
### Details:
Add a dedicated section to the README explaining how to run the seed process. Document the idempotency guarantees and how they're implemented. Explain how to extend or modify seed data as models evolve. Include examples of common seed data modifications. Create a verification script that can be run to validate the seed data is correct and complete. The script should check for expected record counts, verify key relationships, and ensure no orphaned records exist. Add the verification script to the CI pipeline if applicable.

## 6. Create diverse test users for development and QA [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Add seed data for test users covering all user roles and realistic scenarios for development and QA purposes.
### Details:
Define a set of test users with a variety of roles (e.g., admin, regular user, QA, guest) and realistic attributes (names, emails, etc.). Ensure these users are created idempotently using the established helper methods. Document the purpose and credentials of these users in the README for easy reference by developers and QA engineers.

## 7. Evaluate new models for seed data requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish and follow a process to review all new models as they are created to determine if they require seed data, and update the seed files and documentation accordingly.
### Details:
For every new model introduced to the application, assess whether seed data is needed for development, QA, or production environments. If so, add appropriate seed data using idempotent patterns and update the documentation to reflect the change. Ensure this evaluation is part of the model creation workflow.
