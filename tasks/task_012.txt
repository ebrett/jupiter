# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow with Refresh Token Handling for Nationbuilder V2 API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a complete OAuth2 implementation for the Nationbuilder V2 API that handles both initial authorization and automatic token refresh, ensuring continuous API access without requiring user re-authentication.
# Details:
This task requires implementing the full OAuth2 authorization code flow and refresh token mechanism for the Nationbuilder V2 API integration. Key implementation details include:

1. **Initial Authorization Flow**:
   - Create OAuth2 client configuration with appropriate scopes for Nationbuilder V2 API
   - Implement authorization request endpoint that redirects users to Nationbuilder
   - Create callback handler to process authorization codes
   - Exchange authorization code for initial access and refresh tokens
   - Store both tokens securely in the database with user association and expiration metadata

2. **Token Refresh Mechanism**:
   - Implement token expiration detection (access tokens expire after 24 hours)
   - Create a service to handle automatic refresh token exchange
   - Update the stored tokens after successful refresh
   - Implement proper error handling for refresh failures

3. **API Request Handling**:
   - Create a request wrapper that verifies token validity before making API calls
   - Automatically trigger refresh flow when access token is expired
   - Retry failed requests with new tokens when appropriate

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle invalid/expired refresh tokens
   - Manage user revocation scenarios
   - Implement graceful fallbacks when refresh fails
   - Add appropriate logging for debugging authentication issues

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Ensure tokens are stored securely (encrypted if necessary)
   - Implement proper token rotation and management
   - Follow OAuth2 security best practices

6. **Code Organization**:
   - Create reusable OAuth2 client services
   - Separate authentication logic from API business logic
   - Design for testability with dependency injection

The implementation should be robust enough to handle all common OAuth2 edge cases while providing a seamless experience for users.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this OAuth2 implementation should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the authorization and refresh flows:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test token storage and retrieval mechanisms
   - Verify token expiration detection logic
   - Test refresh token service in isolation with mocked responses
   - Validate error handling for various failure scenarios

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Create tests that mock the Nationbuilder OAuth endpoints
   - Verify the full authorization code flow from request to token storage
   - Test the refresh token flow with simulated expired access tokens
   - Ensure API requests properly detect expired tokens and trigger refresh

3. **Mock Server Tests**:
   - Set up a mock OAuth2 server that simulates Nationbuilder's behavior
   - Test against this server to verify correct request/response handling
   - Simulate various error conditions (invalid tokens, server errors)

4. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Create a sandbox Nationbuilder account for testing if possible
   - Verify the complete flow works against the actual API
   - Test the user experience through the authorization process

5. **Specific Test Cases**:
   - Successful initial authorization and token storage
   - Successful token refresh when access token expires
   - Failed refresh due to invalid refresh token
   - Failed refresh due to revoked access
   - API call with valid token
   - API call with expired token that triggers refresh
   - Concurrent API calls handling token refresh properly
   - Edge cases like network failures during refresh

6. **Test Fixtures and Helpers**:
   - Create fixtures for various token states (valid, expired, etc.)
   - Implement time manipulation helpers to test expiration without waiting

All tests should be automated and included in the CI pipeline to ensure ongoing functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement OAuth2 Client Configuration and Initial Authorization Flow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the OAuth2 client configuration and implement the initial authorization flow that redirects users to Nationbuilder for authentication and handles the callback with authorization code.
### Details:
1. Create an OAuth2Client class with configuration parameters (client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, scopes)
2. Implement an authorization URL generator method that builds the proper Nationbuilder authorization URL with required parameters
3. Create an endpoint in the application that redirects users to this authorization URL
4. Implement a callback handler endpoint that receives the authorization code from Nationbuilder
5. Add appropriate error handling for authorization failures
6. Use environment variables for sensitive OAuth configuration

Implementation Plan and Code Structure for OAuth2 Client Configuration and Initial Authorization Flow:

**Files/Components:**
- app/services/oauth2_client.rb: Service class for OAuth2 logic (client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, scopes, authorization_url)
- app/controllers/nationbuilder_auth_controller.rb: Controller for OAuth endpoints (redirect and callback actions)
- config/routes.rb: Add routes for /auth/nationbuilder and /auth/nationbuilder/callback
- .env: Store NATIONBUILDER_CLIENT_ID, NATIONBUILDER_CLIENT_SECRET, NATIONBUILDER_REDIRECT_URI
- (Optional) config/initializers/nationbuilder_oauth.rb: Centralize config loading if needed

**Key Steps:**
1. Oauth2Client service: builds authorization URL from ENV/config
2. Controller: redirect action sends user to Nationbuilder, callback action handles code/error
3. Routes: map /auth/nationbuilder and /auth/nationbuilder/callback
4. All secrets/config from ENV, never hardcoded
5. Error handling for missing/invalid params and OAuth errors

**Testing:**
- Unit test Oauth2Client#authorization_url for correct URL generation
- Integration test controller flow with mocks

**Potential Challenges:**
- Ensuring correct redirect URI registration with Nationbuilder
- Handling all error cases gracefully

This plan covers the structure and initial implementation approach for subtask 12.1. Next step: implement the service, controller, and routes as described.
