# Jupiter Development Scratchpad

This file contains ideas, improvements, and future enhancements for the Jupiter application.

## Feature Flag Management

### Current State
Feature flags are managed via Rails runner commands, which are verbose and hard to remember.

### Improvement Ideas
- **Create Rake tasks for feature flag management** - Make common operations easier
  ```bash
  bin/rake flags:enable[nationbuilder_signin]
  bin/rake flags:disable[nationbuilder_signin] 
  bin/rake flags:status[nationbuilder_signin]
  bin/rake flags:toggle[nationbuilder_signin]
  bin/rake flags:list
  ```

- **Create bash scripts for convenience** - Even simpler one-liners
  ```bash
  bin/enable-oauth          # Enables NationBuilder OAuth
  bin/disable-oauth         # Disables NationBuilder OAuth
  bin/toggle-oauth          # Toggles NationBuilder OAuth
  bin/flag-status <name>    # Shows status of any flag
  ```

- **Admin UI for feature flags** - Web interface for non-technical users
  - Add to admin panel/dashboard
  - Toggle switches for each flag
  - Description and impact warnings
  - Audit log of flag changes

## Authentication & UX

### Mobile Navigation
- âœ… Mobile hamburger menu implemented with plain JavaScript
- ðŸ”„ **TODO: Investigate Stimulus mobile compatibility issue** (GitHub issue #47)
  - Test other Stimulus controllers on mobile
  - Consider mobile-specific Stimulus debugging
  - May need to file upstream bug report

### Authentication Flow
- âœ… Dedicated sign-in/sign-up pages implemented
- âœ… NationBuilder OAuth integration with feature flag system
- âœ… OAuth button styling improved - professional indigo theme with proper spacing and interactions
- **Consider adding social auth providers**
  - Google OAuth
  - GitHub OAuth (for developer-focused features)
  - Apple Sign In (for iOS users)

### Password Management
- **Add password reset functionality**
  - Forgot password flow
  - Email-based reset tokens
  - Password strength indicators
  - Password history (prevent reuse)

## Recent Development Journal

### 2025-07-03 - OAuth Button Styling Improvements
**Problem**: NationBuilder OAuth buttons had poor visual design with basic gray borders, looking unprofessional compared to the main authentication forms.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Redesigned OAuth buttons with indigo color scheme (complementary to blue primary buttons)
- Added professional styling: `border-2 border-indigo-600 rounded-lg bg-indigo-50 text-indigo-700`
- Enhanced interactivity with hover states and smooth transitions
- Improved spacing and typography for better visual hierarchy
- Fixed divider rendering issues (self-closing div tags) and improved text padding
- Updated both sign-in and sign-up pages consistently

**Technical Details**:
- Files modified: `app/views/sessions/new.html.erb`, `app/views/users/new.html.erb`
- Used Tailwind CSS utility classes for consistent design system
- Added focus states for accessibility compliance
- Improved icon choice and positioning

**Result**: OAuth integration now has professional, trustworthy appearance that matches overall application design quality.
