You're absolutely right to question the service object approach! I've always believed that Rails gives us a beautiful, simple architecture with controllers, models, and views - and most of the time, that's all we need.

Service objects are often a premature abstraction that pulls logic out of where it naturally belongs. Let me show you how I'd approach NationBuilder OAuth integration using proper Rails patterns:

## The Controller Handles the Flow

```ruby
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    # Just render the login form with OAuth option
  end

  def create
    if params[:provider] == 'nationbuilder'
      redirect_to nationbuilder_auth_url
    else
      # handle regular login
    end
  end

  def nationbuilder_callback
    user = User.from_nationbuilder_auth(request.env['omniauth.auth'])
    
    if user.persisted?
      session[:user_id] = user.id
      redirect_to root_path, notice: 'Successfully connected with NationBuilder!'
    else
      redirect_to new_session_path, alert: 'Authentication failed'
    end
  rescue NationBuilder::ClientError => e
    redirect_to new_session_path, alert: "NationBuilder error: #{e.message}"
  end

  private

  def nationbuilder_auth_url
    client = nationbuilder_client
    client.authorization_url(
      redirect_uri: nationbuilder_callback_url,
      scope: 'basic profile'
    )
  end

  def nationbuilder_client
    NationBuilder::Client.new(
      client_id: Rails.application.credentials.nationbuilder[:client_id],
      client_secret: Rails.application.credentials.nationbuilder[:client_secret]
    )
  end
end
```

## The Model Owns the Data Logic

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :nationbuilder_tokens, dependent: :destroy

  def self.from_nationbuilder_auth(auth_hash)
    # Find existing user or create new one
    user = find_by(email: auth_hash.info.email) || new(email: auth_hash.info.email)
    
    user.assign_attributes(
      name: auth_hash.info.name,
      nationbuilder_id: auth_hash.uid
    )
    
    if user.save
      user.store_nationbuilder_token(auth_hash.credentials)
    end
    
    user
  end

  def store_nationbuilder_token(credentials)
    nationbuilder_tokens.create!(
      access_token: credentials.token,
      refresh_token: credentials.refresh_token,
      expires_at: Time.at(credentials.expires_at)
    )
  end

  def nationbuilder_client
    token = current_nationbuilder_token
    return nil unless token&.valid?

    NationBuilder::Client.new(
      access_token: token.access_token,
      nation_name: Rails.application.credentials.nationbuilder[:nation_name]
    )
  end

  def sync_with_nationbuilder!
    client = nationbuilder_client
    return false unless client

    nb_person = client.person_show(nationbuilder_id)
    
    update!(
      phone: nb_person.phone,
      address: format_address(nb_person),
      tags: nb_person.tags.join(', '),
      last_synced_at: Time.current
    )
  rescue NationBuilder::ClientError => e
    Rails.logger.error "NationBuilder sync failed for user #{id}: #{e.message}"
    false
  end

  private

  def current_nationbuilder_token
    nationbuilder_tokens.valid.order(:created_at).last
  end

  def format_address(person)
    [person.address1, person.city, person.state].compact.join(', ')
  end
end
```

## Token Management in Its Own Model

```ruby
class NationbuilderToken < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  
  scope :valid, -> { where('expires_at > ?', Time.current) }
  
  def valid?
    expires_at > Time.current
  end

  def refresh!
    client = NationBuilder::Client.new(
      client_id: Rails.application.credentials.nationbuilder[:client_id],
      client_secret: Rails.application.credentials.nationbuilder[:client_secret]
    )
    
    response = client.refresh_token(refresh_token)
    
    update!(
      access_token: response.access_token,
      refresh_token: response.refresh_token,
      expires_at: Time.at(response.expires_at)
    )
  end
end
```

## Background Jobs for Heavy Lifting

```ruby
class NationbuilderSyncJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(user_id)
    user = User.find(user_id)
    user.sync_with_nationbuilder!
  end
end
```

## Why This is Better Than Service Objects

1. **It follows Rails conventions** - Controllers handle HTTP, models handle data
2. **It's discoverable** - When I want to know how OAuth works, I look at the controller
3. **It's testable** - I can test each piece in isolation without complex service object setup
4. **It's maintainable** - The logic lives where Rails developers expect to find it

The key insight is that OAuth is fundamentally about HTTP requests and user data - which maps perfectly to controllers and models. No need to abstract it into service objects that just add indirection.
