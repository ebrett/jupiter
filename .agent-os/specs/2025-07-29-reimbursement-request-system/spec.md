> Spec: Reimbursement Request System
> Created: 2025-07-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive reimbursement request system that replaces Google Forms with a secure, structured workflow featuring file upload capabilities, multi-level approval processes, and real-time status tracking for Democrats Abroad treasury operations.

## User Stories

### Member Reimbursement Submission

As a DA country committee member, I want to submit reimbursement requests through a structured form with receipt uploads, so that I can get reimbursed for authorized expenses without using Google Forms.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Member logs in via NationBuilder OAuth
- Selects "Reimbursement Request" from dashboard
- Fills out structured form with expense details, dates, amounts, and descriptions
- Uploads receipt images/documents (PDF, JPG, PNG)
- Submits request and receives confirmation with tracking number
- Receives email notifications for status changes
- Can view request status and approval progress in real-time

### Treasury Approval Processing

As a treasury administrator, I want to review and approve reimbursement requests with full context and documentation, so that I can maintain financial controls while expediting legitimate requests.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Receives email notification of new reimbursement request
- Views request details with uploaded receipts in admin dashboard
- Reviews expense against organizational policies and budget
- Approves, rejects, or requests additional information
- Adds approval notes and comments for audit trail
- System automatically notifies member of decision

### Request Status Tracking

As both a member and treasury staff, I want to track the status of reimbursement requests in real-time, so that everyone has visibility into the approval process and timeline.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Dashboard shows all requests with current status (submitted, under review, approved, rejected, paid)
- Color-coded status indicators and progress bars
- Audit trail showing all actions and timestamps
- Search and filter capabilities for finding specific requests
- Export capabilities for accounting reconciliation

## Spec Scope

1. **Reimbursement Request Form** - Structured form with validation for expense details, amounts, dates, and purpose
2. **File Upload System** - Receipt and document upload with secure storage and retrieval
3. **Approval Workflow Engine** - Role-based approval routing with configurable rules
4. **Status Tracking Dashboard** - Real-time visibility into request progress for all stakeholders
5. **Email Notification System** - Automated notifications for status changes and required actions

## Out of Scope

- Vendor payment requests (separate Phase 1 feature)
- Budget tracking and allocation (Phase 2 feature)
- Integration with external accounting systems (Phase 5 feature)
- Mobile app development (web-responsive only)
- Bulk operations and batch processing (Phase 2 feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Reimbursement System** - Members can submit requests, upload receipts, and track status through completion
2. **Treasury Admin Interface** - Treasury staff can review, approve/reject requests with full audit trail
3. **Automated Email Notifications** - All stakeholders receive timely updates on request status changes
