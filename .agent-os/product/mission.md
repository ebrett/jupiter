## Pitch

DA Finances Application (DAFA) is a Treasury administration web application that helps Democrats Abroad streamline reimbursement requests, vendor payments, and in-kind donation tracking by replacing Google Forms with a secure, role-based approval workflow system integrated with NationBuilder.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Democrats Abroad Treasury Teams**: Central and country committee treasury staff managing payment workflows
- **DA Members**: Country committee members submitting reimbursement and payment requests
- **DA Administrators**: System administrators managing user access and organizational oversight

### User Personas

**Country Committee Member** (25-70 years old)

## The Problem

### Manual Treasury Processes

Current Google Forms-based system creates administrative overhead with manual data entry, unclear approval workflows, and limited tracking capabilities. This results in delayed payments and increased administrative burden.

**Our Solution:** Automated approval workflows with role-based access control and integrated status tracking.

### Fragmented User Management

Managing access across multiple Google Forms without centralized authentication creates security risks and administrative complexity. Users must manage separate credentials for each form.

**Our Solution:** Single sign-on through NationBuilder OAuth leveraging existing DA member accounts.

### Limited Financial Oversight

Google Forms provide minimal audit trails and lack structured approval processes required for financial accountability in political organizations.

**Our Solution:** Comprehensive audit logging, policy-based authorization, and structured approval workflows.

## Differentiators

### NationBuilder Integration

Unlike generic form solutions, DAFA leverages the existing NationBuilder infrastructure that all DA members already use. This provides seamless authentication and eliminates the need for separate account management.

### Political Organization Compliance

DAFA is built specifically for political organization requirements with proper audit trails, role-based permissions, and financial oversight capabilities that generic tools lack.

### Treasury-Specific Workflows

Unlike general-purpose expense management tools, DAFA implements workflows specifically designed for political organization treasury operations including in-kind donation tracking and grant management.
