## 2025-01-27: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

DA Finances Application (DAFA) will serve as a proof-of-concept Treasury administration tool for Democrats Abroad, initially replacing Google Forms for reimbursement requests, vendor payments, and in-kind donation tracking, with future expansion to grant management capabilities.

### Context

Democrats Abroad currently relies on Google Forms for treasury operations, creating manual overhead, security concerns, and limited audit capabilities. All DA members have NationBuilder accounts, providing an opportunity for seamless integration and user adoption.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Commercial Expense Management Solutions**
   - Pros: Feature-complete, battle-tested, vendor support
   - Cons: High cost, generic workflows, no political organization features, complex user management

2. **Custom Google Workspace Solutions**
   - Pros: Familiar interface, low initial cost, Google ecosystem integration
   - Cons: Limited audit trails, security concerns, manual processes persist, scalability issues

3. **Open Source Expense Tools**
   - Pros: Customizable, lower cost, community support
   - Cons: Generic design, requires significant customization, ongoing maintenance burden

### Rationale

Building a custom solution allows for:
- Political organization-specific compliance features
- Seamless NationBuilder integration leveraging existing user accounts
- Treasury workflow optimization based on DA-specific requirements
- Future extensibility for grant management and other DA treasury needs
- Complete control over data security and audit requirements

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Streamlined treasury operations with automated workflows
- Enhanced security through centralized authentication and proper audit trails
- Scalable foundation for future DA treasury technology needs
- Reduced administrative burden on treasury staff
- Improved member experience with familiar NationBuilder authentication

**Negative:**
- Development time and resource investment required
- Ongoing maintenance and support responsibilities
- Risk of scope creep as additional treasury needs are identified
- Dependency on NationBuilder for core authentication functionality

## 2025-01-27: Technical Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

DAFA will be built using Rails 8.0.2 with Hotwire for frontend interactivity, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and NationBuilder OAuth as the primary authentication mechanism, following Rails conventions and leveraging Rails 8's built-in features for background processing and caching.

### Context

Need to select a technology stack that balances rapid development, maintainability, and alignment with the team's expertise while supporting the specific requirements of a political organization treasury system.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **React/Node.js SPA Architecture**
   - Pros: Modern frontend experience, extensive ecosystem, API-first design
   - Cons: Increased complexity, two codebases to maintain, longer development timeline

2. **Rails with traditional jQuery frontend**
   - Pros: Simple, proven approach, rapid development
   - Cons: Less interactive user experience, outdated frontend patterns

### Rationale

Rails 8.0.2 with Hotwire provides:
- Rapid development with convention over configuration
- Built-in security features essential for political organizations
- Solid Queue/Cache/Cable eliminating external dependencies
- ViewComponent architecture for maintainable UI components
- Comprehensive testing ecosystem with RSpec
- Strong Ruby/Rails team expertise
- Modern frontend capabilities without SPA complexity

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster time to market with Rails conventions
- Reduced infrastructure complexity with built-in Rails 8 features
- Strong security foundation for sensitive political data
- Maintainable codebase with established patterns
- Modern user experience through Hotwire

**Negative:**
- Potential frontend limitations compared to React/Vue ecosystems
- Dependency on Rails ecosystem for future feature development

## 2025-01-27: Authentication Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Security Team, DA IT

### Decision

Implement NationBuilder OAuth as the primary authentication method with email/password fallback, using Rails 8's built-in encryption for token storage and comprehensive session management with device tracking.

### Context

All Democrats Abroad members have NationBuilder accounts, making OAuth integration the most user-friendly approach while maintaining security requirements for political organization data.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Email/Password Only Authentication**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, no external dependencies, full control
   - Cons: User friction, additional account management, security burden

2. **Third-party OAuth (Google, Facebook)**
   - Pros: Familiar to users, established security
   - Cons: No organizational context, potential member privacy concerns

### Rationale

NationBuilder OAuth integration provides:
- Seamless user experience for all DA members
- Organizational context and member verification
- Reduced account management overhead
- Leveraging existing DA infrastructure investment
- Enhanced security through established OAuth patterns

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero-friction user onboarding for DA members
- Organizational context available for authorization decisions
- Reduced support burden for password resets and account issues
- Enhanced trust through familiar authentication flow

**Negative:**
- Dependency on NationBuilder service availability
- Complexity in handling OAuth error scenarios
- Need for fallback authentication for edge cases

## 2025-07-29: Reimbursement Request State Management Architecture

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team
**Related Spec:** @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-reimbursement-request-system/

### Decision

Use Rails native enum with timestamps approach for reimbursement request state management instead of AASM state machine or event sourcing frameworks, with a separate events table for audit trail logging.

### Context

While implementing the reimbursement request system, we needed to choose an approach for managing request states (draft → submitted → approved → paid) that would provide proper audit trails while maintaining simplicity for MVP development.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **AASM State Machine (Original Plan)**
   - Pros: Robust state management, built-in guards and callbacks, comprehensive workflow definitions
   - Cons: Additional gem dependency, increased complexity, potential over-engineering for MVP

2. **Event Sourcing with Eventide**
   - Pros: Complete audit trail, time travel capabilities, microservices-ready architecture
   - Cons: Significant architectural complexity, steep learning curve, infrastructure overhead

3. **Simple Enum with Timestamps (Selected)**
   - Pros: Rails-native approach, no external dependencies, easy to understand and test, adequate audit trail
   - Cons: Manual state transition validation, requires separate audit events implementation

### Rationale

For an MVP replacing Google Forms, the simple enum approach provides the optimal balance of:
- **Rapid Development**: Uses standard Rails conventions and patterns
- **Maintainability**: No external dependencies to manage or update
- **Audit Requirements**: Separate events table provides complete audit trail
- **Team Velocity**: Easier for team members to understand and contribute to
- **Future Flexibility**: Can evolve to more sophisticated approaches as system matures

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster implementation using Rails built-in enum functionality
- No external gem dependencies to manage
- Clear, testable state transition methods
- Complete audit trail through dedicated events table
- Easier debugging and troubleshooting
- Reduced learning curve for team members

**Negative:**
- Manual implementation of state transition guards and validations
- Potential for inconsistent state transitions without framework enforcement
- Need to build custom audit logging instead of automatic AASM callbacks
- May require refactoring to more sophisticated approach in future phases
